# calculator

Technlogies used:

CSS (flexbox)

JS (vanilla)

Calculator always rounds to 2 decimal places.

Main goals that I achieved:

- implement things like minus and minus equals plus, can't divide by zero etc.
- flexibility with calculator, which means a lot of functionality for user to work with
- bug less code (tested it a lot, everything should be 100% accurate)
- learn to use 'this' keyword
- learn how to work with regex patterns
