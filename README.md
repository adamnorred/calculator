# calculator

Technlogies used:

CSS (flexbox)

JS (vanilla)

Calculator always rounds to 2 decimal places and simplifies outcome i.e. if there is 0.0066 it will round to 0.01. Used method 'toFixed' to avoid flooding screen, since it is project for training.

Main goals that I achieved:

- implement things like minus and minus equals plus, can't divide by zero etc.
- flexibility with calculator, which means a lot of functionality for user to work with
- bug less code (tested it a lot, everything should be 100% accurate)
- learn to use 'this' keyword
- learn how to work with regex patterns
